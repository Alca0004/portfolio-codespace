# Portfolio  

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a showcase of my work as a front-end web developer, highlighting my skills in **HTML & CSS**.  

## About  

This is my first fully custom portfolio, built from the ground up. I drew inspiration from various websites but added my own unique touch. 

## Features  

- **Built with HTML and CSS** (No JavaScript)  
- **Features dark mode by default** using a refined black and grey foundation enhanced by a warm, earthy color palette from colorhunt.co
- **Sticky navbar** with a centered layout and subtle hover effects  
- **Font Awesome icons** integrated for a clean, visual touch
- **Easy-to-update structure** for adding future projects  

## Future Plans  

This portfolio will evolve as I continue improving my skills and adding new projects.
